            <p> Racism against the Native Americans started when the Europeans came to the native land; the Europeans had plans to conquer the land and the Europeans personally thought that the Natives were savages when in reality, the Natives were trying to protect their land. Due to all of the disturbance that the Europeans and the Natives caused to each other, the Europeans fought back by bringing in more Europeans to the Native land and either killed or trained all the Natives to have European customs. (e.x. residential schools and the establishment of “Indian reservations”) </p>

                <p> In the 17th century, Africans were sent as slaves and most of them were kidnapped from their homeland in Africa. African men, women, and children were stripped of their names and identities, they were forced to be “Christianized”. Many of the slaves were brutally tortured. Not all Africans that came to America were slaves, some of them lived in the southern states and started a new live there. There have been discriminatory laws set in place that prohibit Africans to start a new life here. In 1865, slavery have been abolished and years following that, there have been laws prohibiting discrimination against African-Americans. </p>

                <p> In December of 1941, Japan was the cause of the bombing attack in Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Ever since that attack, racism between Japanese-American have increased tremendously, with harassment and discrimination. In February 1942 an Executive Order was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that authorized the internment of Japanese Americans. Over 120,000 Japanese Americans sent to the camps were born and raised in the U.S. On March 20, 1946 all Japanese American citizens were released from internment camps. </p>
